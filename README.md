### THIS IS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK  

1. search and install **node.js**  
2. open a terminal in folder and use **npm i**
3. open index.js in this project folder  
4. fill-in your **id** & **password**, which is same as your school ones  
5. see if you want the program to close the browser after shxt  
6. see if you want the browser window to show then you can see the progress  
7. before you start, make sure that there're only the courses you want to select in your pre-schedule list. I can't guarantee the functionality if there's any course conflict.  
8. in terminal use **node index.js**
  
### MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE DONE STEP 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8
